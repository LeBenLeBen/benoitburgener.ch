I’ve already got a blog, many blogs, in the past, but it has never been a satisfaction for me. I spent too much time writing on boring topics that didn’t even interest me. During these last months, several times, I wanted to write. Write about things that fascinates me and which I think may interest some of you.

So I decided to build a website about me, my projects and my thoughts. That sounds really egocentric, I admit. As this task was not difficult enough, I set to do it in English like most of web-related content. I’m anything but a native English speaker, I try to do my best but I know you’re going to read a lot of mistakes. Feel free to correct me.

If you’re interested about the website itself, you can read the [acknowledgments](/acknowledgments.html). If you’re interested about web technologies, subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml). If `tl;dr` is your thing, you better [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/LeBenLeBen).
